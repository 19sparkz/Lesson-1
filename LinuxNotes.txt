Introduction to Linux

What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) modeled after UNIX.

It is freely distributable and can be downloaded, used, and modified by anyone.

Linux is not just an OS; it is also a kernel that serves as the core for a wide variety of operating systems.


=========================
Linux vs. Windows and macOS

Open Source: Linux source code is available to the public and anyone can view, modify, or distribute it. Windows and macOS, however, are proprietary and their source codes are not openly accessible.

Customization: Linux offers more freedom for customization compared to Windows and macOS.

Privacy & Security: Linux is generally considered more secure and privacy-focused than Windows. macOS is secure but less customizable.

Software Updates: Linux distributions manage updates through a centralized package manager, offering more control over when and how updates are installed compared to Windows and macOS.

System Resources: Linux typically requires fewer system resources (e.g., less memory and processing power), which makes it ideal for older hardware.

Popular Linux Distributions
Ubuntu: Known for its user-friendliness and community support.

Fedora: Features cutting-edge technology and innovation.

Debian: Praised for its stability and reliability.

CentOS: Preferred for servers due to its stability and long-term support.

Linux in DevOps
Why is Linux Preferred in DevOps?



Versatility and Flexibility: Linux can be easily integrated into various tools and environments, making it a preferred choice for DevOps tools and pipelines.

Scripting and Automation: The availability of powerful shell scripting and automation tools (like Bash) makes Linux ideal for automating repetitive tasks and workflows.

Containerization: Linux is the backbone of container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, which are central to modern DevOps practices.

CI/CD Tools: Most continuous integration/continuous deployment tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, Github Actions are optimized for Linux environments.

Practical DevOps Application
Automating server setups using shell scripts.

Managing application deployments using Docker and Kubernetes on Linux servers.

Configuring CI/CD pipelines on Linux-based systems to ensure seamless software delivery.
